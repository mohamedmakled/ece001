		<h1>Mobile Computing - Current Trends</h1>
		<p>This chapter lists down the current mobile technologies starting from 3G technologies which is the hottest mobile technology available in the market.</p>
		<ol>
		<li>3G:
			<p>3 G or third generation mobile telecommunications are standards developed by the International Telecommunications Union for mobile phones and mobile telecommunications services which comply with the International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) specifications. Application services include wide-ranging wireless voice telephones, mobile Internet access, video calls and mobile television, all in a mobile environment</p>
		</li>
		<li>Global Positioning System (GPS)
			<p>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based satellite navigation system that provides location and time information in all weather, anywhere on or near the Earth, where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. The GPS program provides critical capabilities to military, civil and commercial users around the world. In addition, GPS is the backbone for modernizing the global air traffic system, weather, and location services.</p>
		</li>
		<li>Long Term Evolution (LTE):
			<p>LTE is a standard for wireless communication of high-speed data for mobile phones and data terminals. It is based on the GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA network technologies, increasing the capacity and speed using new modulation techniques. It is related with the implementation of fourth Generation (4G) technology.</li>
		<li>WiMAX:
			<p>WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a wireless communications standard designed to provide 30 to 40 megabit-per-second data rates, with the latest update providing up to 1 Gbit/s for fixed stations. It is a part of a fourth generation or 4G wireless-communication technology. WiMAX far surpasses the 30-metre wireless range of a conventional Wi-Fi Local Area Network (LAN), offering a metropolitan area network with a signal radius of about 50 km. WiMAX offers data transfer rates that can be superior to conventional cable-modem and DSL connections, however, the bandwidth must be shared among multiple users and thus yields lower speed in practice.
				
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>Near Field Communication:
			<p>Near Field Communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones and similar devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into close proximity, usually no more than a few centimeters. Present and anticipated applications include contactless transactions, data exchange, and simplified setup of more complex communications such as Wi-Fi. Communication is also possible between an NFC device and an unpowered NFC chip, called a "tag".</p>
